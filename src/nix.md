# I Use Windows, Get Me Out Of Here!

Welcome to the dark side. You'll appreciate the performance benefits from not needing to virtualise Linux inside Windows.
Just use Linux. Your programs won't miss you, we promise.

If you're not convinced, [watch this](https://youtu.be/CwfKlX3rA6E).

Tip: Open this guide on another device (such as your phone) because soon you'll need to reboot your computer and then you won't be able to see this guide.

Note: This guide assumes you're on Windows and using an x86_64 computer. If you don't know what that is, you probably are.

1. Find or buy a USB stick and plug it into your computer.
2. Check the contents of the USB stick. It will be completely deleted, so make sure there's nothing important on it.
3. [Download NixOS][nixos].
4. [Download Balena Etcher][etcher].
